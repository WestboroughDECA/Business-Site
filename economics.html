            Macroeconomics L5 introduces students to the basic principles of macroeconomics and their application to the economic system as a whole. Students will examine the economic conditions of full-employment, recessionary gap, and inflationary gap presented through the use of various graphs, charts, and data in order to analyze and determine plans for returning the economy to optimum level. This course will explore many of these concepts through the use of current events that bring the theoretical to life. Students will work both individually and collaboratively to construct and present economic findings that will aid in their academic success.

            <p>
              It is almost impossible to listen to any newscast or read a newspaper today without seeing economics at work in the world around us. This course provides students with a thorough preparation for the AP examination in Microeconomics by studying the forces that influence financial decisions made by consumers and producers within our economic system. The four models of economic competition will be examined in relationship to the product and factor markets, with emphasis placed on graphical analysis, cost curves, and the determinants of supply and demand. The role of government in promoting greater efficiency to correct market failures and equity will also be studied.
